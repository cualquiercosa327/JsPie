# JsPie

A programmable input emulator that uses JavaScript.
Lets you take inputs from the keyboard, mouse, joystick, game controller, etc. and produce outputs such as simulated keystrokes, mouse movements, joystick controls, etc.

A replacement for GlovePIE, but with some noteworthy differences:

* Not intended as a development environment.  Scripts are written in JavaScript, so you can use your choice of text editor or IDE.
* Simple command line application to run scripts so that it can be triggered or integrated easily.
* Open source; collaboration encouraged.

Currently in the very early stages of development...
